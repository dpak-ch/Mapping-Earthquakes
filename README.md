# Mapping Earthquakes
The purpose of this repository is to display earthquake data, along with tectonic plates. The code helps display earthquake data over the past 7 days, and major earthquakes with magnitude > 4.5 on the Richter scale. A feature layer containing the tectonic plates shows prevalence of major earthquakes along the plate boundaries.
